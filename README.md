# Cramer's Rule Calculator

Welcome to the Cramer's Rule Calculator project! This is a simple program written in C++ that allows you to solve a system of linear equations using Cramer's Rule. You don't need to be a programmer to use it, just follow the instructions below!

## What is Cramer's Rule?

Cramer's Rule is a mathematical method used to solve systems of linear equations, named after Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer. It uses the determinants of matrices to find the solutions.

## How to Use the Program

1. **Download the Code**: First, you'll need to download the code onto your computer. You can do this by clicking the green 'Code' button on the GitHub page and then clicking 'Download ZIP'. Once the ZIP file has downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice.

2. **Compile the Code**: This step requires a C++ compiler. If you don't have one installed, you can download one like g++ or clang++. Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the extracted code files, and type the following command:

```bash
g++ -o CramerCalculator main.cpp CramerCalculator.cpp Matrix.cpp SystemOfEquations.cpp
